## How to use
### Set up your account on AWS
1. Create an account and get your credentials (click on your account name -> select My security credentials -> click Access keys). Copy these 2 keys into the following env variables:

**AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**
**AWS_SECRET_KEY**

2. Create a bucket. Add its name as another env variable:
**AWS_BUCKET_NAME**

3. Change your bucket permissions. 
- In the Block public access unblock all properties
- In the Access Control list, add Public access to read and write objects
- In the Bucket policy, add something like that:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy15605345364204",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt156012333612",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your_bucket_name>/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
It's just an example because this policy grants a right to get object. It's useful when you need to provide a public access to your files.


### Add component
```javascript
import FileUploader from '@src/modules/fileUploader/FileUploader.jsx';
```

Add the component:

```
    <FileUploader 
        showFileName={true} 
        previewWidth="200px" 
        previewHeight="120px"
        previewIsRound={false}
        generateIdName={true} />
```
Before using, in the parent component's constructor, add the following line:
```
this.fileUploader = React.createRef(); // Name of the object can be any.
```
Then in the <FileUploader> component add the following line: 

```
ref={this.fileUploader}
```
Then you will be able to call the upload process just calling:

```
const uploadData = await this.fileUploader.current.upload(); 
console.log(uploadData.result);
console.log(uploadData.urls);
```
The returning result is a JavaScript object in the format:
```
{
    result: true/false,
    urls: array of URLs newly uploaded files
}
```
